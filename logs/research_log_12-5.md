- Subjects 2-4
- Continued EEG preprocessing and ICA analysis for the Parkinson’s project.
- Performed ICA component inspection and artifact labeling, focusing on:
- Muscle artifacts (high-frequency power up to ~45 Hz).
- Ear/temporal artifacts with lateralized topographies.
- Analyzed PSD profiles of individual ICs, noting:
    Flat spectra beyond ~10–20 Hz in non-muscle components.
- Clear high-frequency elevation in muscle-related ICs.
