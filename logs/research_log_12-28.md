Activity: Outreach to Researchers

Objective:
To seek guidance on methodology, feature selection, and mechanistic interpretation of EEG-based predictive models for cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Focused on connecting resting-state EEG features to neural mechanisms using interpretable machine learning.

Actions Taken:
- Drafted and finalized four outreach emails to researchers in EEG, machine learning, and PD.
- Highlighted personal background and prior research experience (CSULA microscopy lab, alpha-synuclein aggregates).
- Described current project: resting-state EEG preprocessing (MNE-Python), feature extraction (FFT, DWT, PLV, PLI), and interpretable ML approaches (SHAP/LIME).
- Emphasized theory-driven, mechanistically grounded analyses over purely statistical correlations.

Tailored each email to the recipient’s expertise:
    > Dr. Cole: PD cognitive impairment, EEG biomarkers.
    > Dr. Dasgupta: Linear predictive coding, EEG signal processing, ML interpretability.
    > Dr. Caviness: PD EEG mechanisms, longitudinal data, predictive modeling, biomarker discovery.
    > Dr. Vanegas: EEG-based ML biomarkers, visual cortex dynamics in PD.`

Tailored questions for each researcher for elevance:
- Feature-to-physiology mapping (electrodes, frequency bands).
- Aggregation strategies for interdependent EEG features.
- Improving interpretability of ML models in EEG.
- Guidance or referrals to other researchers if unavailable.
- Scheduled emails to be sent on Jan 5, 2025, 9:15 AM for after winter break new Year.
