Research Log – 11/24/2025

Tasks Completed
- Adjusted preproccessing to including detection of bad channels using LOF (still tinkering w/ parameters)
- Noted that Subject 1 is extremely noisy; high LOF sensitivity over-flagged channels
- Ran ICA noticed changes in components (Sub 01 must be redone)
- Adjusted order of preproccessing for interpolation, montage, and bad channel detection
- Received email from Dr. Cavanagh replying to my questions

Next Steps
- Run Preproccessing on all 150 subjects and save data
- Adjust interpolation procedure as needed
- Complete ICA to remove eye, muscle, heartbeat and line noise artifacts
- Semiautomate artifact rejection
