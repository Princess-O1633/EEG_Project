Research Log - 12/6/2025

- Went back to Subject 2 for rough muscle artifacts (Behind on schedule)
- Problems with classicication of neural and artifact ICA detection (ICA008, ICA018, ICA017 right temporal region)
- Dipole musclular components investigated
- Worked with kurtosis for determing muscle artifact and skimmed two papers about it but kurtosis alone is not the best critreria
- Plotted PSD of ICA components but huge mess?
- Made notes on why each component was rejected
- Learned about the segment image relevance to artifact detection and correlation between burst and muscle activity
- Added pages for subjects 11-50 on Notion and plotted all ICA components to prepare for school week work
